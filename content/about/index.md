Hi. I'm a millennial living on Earth.

I've flirted with the idea of writing a blog for years but never committed out of laziness, and because who reads blogs anymore anyways? I finally decided to make a blog to fulfill my need to yap and so other people can be spared from having to listen to my yapping.

This blog is intentionally minimal, because I can't be bothered to configure and maintain that shit.
There's no google analytics, so you can lurk secretly :)

I'm not great at talking about myself so I'll just list some bullet points in no particular order.
